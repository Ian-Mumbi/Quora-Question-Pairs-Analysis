# Quora Question Pairs Analysis

This is an analysis for the Kaggle Competition for building a machine learning model that predicts duplicate questions asked on Quora.

This has the business objective of reducing duplication and having to answer previously asked questions on the platform.

Some of the important notes of this business problem are:

+ No latecy constraint.
+ Mistakes can be quite costly.
+ Interpratability is not of much concern hence more complex models with limited interpratability can be used.
